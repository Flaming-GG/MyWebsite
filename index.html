        Hello, I am a begginer to coding. This is my first public website. It's nice to meet you all :) <br>
        I will either be adding more to THIS website or make a new website for a future task or something like that.<br>
        I'm not so familiar with 'css' however, I can handle the basics with 'HTML' which I'm using to create this website.<br>
        The coding platforms which I use is just Python so far but I'm currently learning how to use JavaScript and later<br>
        learn Java because I heard it's good and I'm guessing that Minecraft Java edition was coded using it.
